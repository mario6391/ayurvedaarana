                    We use authentic Panchakarma <em>(= five main cleaning treatments)</em> to stop diseases from occurring and to attain or improve good health. These Panchakarma procedures are used to cure and eliminate the root causes or diseases or ailments for people suffering from various kinds of health issues.

                    During the Panchakarma cure, we clear and remove all toxins from the body. In general, all these treatments will help to relax your body and mind, remove toxin in your body from a cellular level and help to correct functions of all the system in the body.&nbsp;

Oileation – internal and external oil application (e.g. ayurvedic massages, oil drinking)<br><br>
Sudation - warm treatments that cause sweating (e.g. steam bath, sauna, herbal bath, pindasveda)<br><br>

Oil Drinking: This is a typical preparation treatment for Panchakarma. The oil helps to melt your toxins in the body which support the detoxification process later on.<br><br> </p>

                  Ayurvedic teaching regards nutrition as a natural remedy and attaches great importance to it. Accordingly, we prepare your meals in such a way that they are exactly adapted to your type of constitution. Dining in harmony with nature and the Doshas is also a culinary experience that appeals to all the senses.

Sensitized to a conscious diet, you will learn to recognize and consider the needs of your own body. Visit our cooking demonstrations and we will show you how Ayurvedic meals are traditionally prepared. The basic principles are easy to learn and can be taken home as a new experience or inspiration.
