                  <strong>Travel season and climate in Sri Lanka</strong><br>
                In the lower coastal regions, the average annual temperature is 27˚C. In the mountains, i.e. in the middle of the island, it is a bit cooler with just over 20°C. 
                The weather on the island is divided into two climate regions: the west and southwest coast and the east and northeast coast. When it rains on the south/ west coast, the north/ east coast is dry and vice versa. You can find a sunny spot on the island at any time of the year, depending on where you are. Since our Villa Arana is located on the west coast, we will concentrate on this region only. <div><br><br>
                <strong>Climate at the south/ west coast</strong><br><br></div>
               <strong> December to April </strong><br>
                The best time for a holiday on the southwest coast is generally between December and April. February and March are particularly pleasant, as it is relatively dry and not quite so hot.
                <br><br><strong>May and June</strong> (strong southwest monsoon)<br>
                The rainy southwest monsoon brings heavy rainfall to the west and southwest coasts, especially in May and June. It rains heavily again and again, but usually not the whole day.
                <br><br><strong>July to September</strong> (weak southwest monsoon)<br>
                In this time it rains mostly only a few hours in the night and is generally very pleasant again. <br><br>
                <strong>October and November</strong> (northeast monsoon)<br>
                Although the months of October and November are associated with more heavy rainfall, these rain showers are rather short and intense, as well as in the evening and night hours. Therefore, these months can be recommended as low season.<br><br>
                <strong>When is the best travel time for an Ayurveda cure with us?</strong> <br><br>
                An Ayurveda cure is possible at any time of the year and depends mainly on your personal preferences. The cure is even positively influenced during the monsoon season. Due to the high humidity the pores of the skin are open. The various massage oils can thus be absorbed even better. Also in these months there is plenty of sunshine.<br><br>
                If you would like to combine your cure with a round trip, we recommend that you do so before the cure. You can process your impressions in peace with us and then get fully involved in the cure. Afterwards the cure can continue and you can fly back home all relaxed. <br><br>
                If you are unsure about the travel time or would like support in planning your cure (and if you wish a round trip), please contact us. We will be happy to help you make your stay in Sri Lanka the as comfortable as possible.<br><br>
                If you wish, we can also put together a beautiful travel route for you and organise a personal driver for you, who will pick you up at Villa Arana and take you back there.
