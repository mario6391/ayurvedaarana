                   We are a pure Detox &amp; Health Resort, not a mixed service with "normal" tourists. This means, all guests take a cure. The cure follows the Vedic guidelines. The daily routine, the powerful combination of treatments, the coordinated eating and drinking correspond to the traditional Vedas. The doctors carry out daily consultations and thus applications, medicine, food and drink are individually adapted to the patient. The treatment is accompanied by spiritual yoga, which is guided as well as the buddhist meditation.&nbsp;
                    <div><br></div>
                    <div>Already in the ancient Vedas it is written that there is a rhythm for body, mind and soul, called samsara. Translated from Sanskrit, samsara means circulation. It also stands for recurrence and this process is followed by authentic Ayurveda.&nbsp;</div>
                    <div><br></div>
                    <div>By the realization that one should begin one's day in the Vata time, one gets up for this purpose in the morning at sunrise.</div>
                    <div><br></div>
                    <div>For Ayurveda guests this means the first intake of heated water, which supports the metabolism. Only after yoga and meditation there is the Ayurvedic breakfast, no coffee and no black tea, these caffeine-containing drinks would change the constitution sensitively, because they stimulate Pitta and Vata too fast and intensively. Moreover, the pulse diagnosis is falsified by such strong toxins.</div>
                    <div><br></div>
                    <div>We would like to illustrate a typical Ayurveda day during an authentic Panchakarma cure in our Villa Arana using the example of Anna, to give you an overview.&nbsp;</div>
                    <div><br></div>
                    <div>Anna is a well proportioned, powerful and obviously balanced woman in her late thirties. She is a Kapha woman and in the second week of treatment. Although it is always difficult for her as a Kapha woman to get into the aisles in the morning, Anna gets up before sunrise. And indeed, in the Vata time early in the morning, she notices, it is much easier to get up.</div>

                            Anna wakes up and first takes a large glass of hot water. Then she carries out the small morning hygiene and goes to the terrace where the daily yoga takes place. Yoga is a good method in everyday life to master the emerging demands, but in a cure it can bind too much energy and so only a few calm asanas are practiced as preparation for meditation, matching the play of the colors of the rising sun in the sky.

While the Pitta and Vata guests cannot do without a substantial breakfast, Kolakanda, a herbal rice drink, and a fruit plate with papaya and passion fruit are enough for her. Then three small Rotti, wholemeal flat cakes and rice flour with onion ambola and some stimulating spices such as ginger powder or cinnamon, so that the heaviness of the Kapha time of the morning from six to ten o'clock does not appear at all. In contrast to western nutritional teachings, Ayurveda does not believe much in big breakfasts.

One of the basic rules of Ayurvedic nutrition is that the heaviest meal should be eaten around lunchtime, because then the Agni, the digestive fire, is the strongest. Without regular meals, Vata guests soon become tired and unfocused, while Pitta guests quickly become impatient and uncomfortable. Anna eats the menu that has been put together and tailored for her with the highest esteem. <br><br>On the menu there is red rice with channadhal, a tasty chickpea curry, lotus root curry and beetroot curry. Turmeric and cumin balance her doshas. For dessert, there is Laddhus, with jaggery and cinnamon, coconut flakes and sesame seed, this continues to stimulate her Agni, again supporting the phase of the day. Four of these delicious cubes are enough.&nbsp;</p>

                            The Ayurvedic dinner begins. Anna is satisfied with a small, light meal as well as her two friends. As with every meal, there are three courses. Today it is a pumpkin soup and then some rice with fat-free steamed vegetables. Papaya salad concludes the meal, a fruit that Ayurveda regards as a remedy. Since Anna and her friends have set their main meal at noon and renounce snacks between meals, all three of them are better. They also have hardly any problems with their weight.

A short time later, before the beginning of the Pitta phase, Anna fell asleep. <br>After 10pm, when Pitta dominates again, they all do not sleep as well and deeply anymore. Around midnight, from 10pm to 2am to be precise, Pitta has taken over the scepter of the biorhythm. Now Anna's metabolism produces heat for sleep, and mental digestion, the processing of daytime impressions, begins. It is not for nothing that even in the western world it is said that the best sleep is before midnight. <br>Early in the morning, between two and six o'clock, Vata is active. This is the time of intense dreams that Anna always likes to remember.<br>Gradually the body prepares for getting up again and activates the excretory organs<br>Samsara…the cycle…to a new day!</p>
