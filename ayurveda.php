                    Ayurveda is a more than 5000 year old complete medical system. It is based on Sankya &amp; Vaisheshika philosophies, which describe the cosmic evolution. These philosophies describe how the material was formed by the primary universal energy and how then organisms &amp; life were created. The word "Ayurveda" is made up by the two words 'Ayur' + 'Veda'. The word ayur denotes the beginning (genesis), existence and dissolution of the universe, as well as the salvation from the above cycle. The word veda stands for wisdom.&nbsp;

                        Ayurveda refers to much more than the science of life, it refers to the whole universe.&nbsp;
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        In Ayurveda the origin of the whole universe is described including that of all energies, materials &amp; life (plants &amp; animals) through one philosophy.

                In this philosophy, everything is discussed by the Panchabootha &amp; Pancha-Thanmāthra theories. Panchabootha are five basic elements that are present in the universe:&nbsp;

                    The Tri-Dosha are the basic functional factors of the body, named Vata, Pitta and Kapha.

                    <div>
                        <strong>Vata </strong>
                            - The energy that makes or controls/creates all movements. Vata is like electricity.
                    </div>
                
                    <div>
                        <strong>Pitta</strong>
                        - This energy is like fire, the main function of it, is to burn or digest. All chemical reactions in the body are part of Pitta.
                    </div>
                
                    <div>
                        <strong>Kapha</strong> 
                        - It is the watery/ liquid condition of the body. The Kapha energy binds and holds all of our body together.

                    <div><br></div>
                    <div>If the Ayurvedic physician knows the constitution of a person, he can make the right choice from the variety of Ayurvedic treatment methods.<br>

                    The different treatments of Ayurveda activate the self-healing powers of the body and thus lay the foundation for a healthy life in harmony with this individual nature.<br>
                    They lead back to the original individual balance of life energies and thus deprive many diseases, which we often accept as inevitable or treat only symptomatically, of their basis.
                    <br>
                    Dr. Ravi, our chief physician at Villa Arana, has a state degree and many, many years of practical experience.  This allows him to put together an individual cure program for each patient according to their current constitution. Daily consultations are a must in order to control the course and to correct it, if necessary. 
                    <br>
                    Understanding this logic also explains why an authentic cure does not contain any predetermined elements and can only be put together individually by the Ayurvedic doctor.<br>
                    Terms like intensive cure, healing cure, regeneration cure, rejuvenation cure or compact cure are derived from marketing and take the flexibility for the doctor for the selection and dosage from his repertoire - the treatments, the food and the medicine.<br>

                    The individual ayurvedic healing process can only be initiated after the current constitution, the original Dosha constitution and the associated deviations have been determined.</div><br>

                        The aim in Ayurveda is to protect the wellbeing of the healthy &amp; to heal the unhealthy (cure &amp; prevent diseases). What we do through the Ayurveda Panchakarma is the elimination of stagnated polluted materials &amp; energies which are the main cause of illness, then bringing all the internal energies to the natural equilibrium.&nbsp;

                        We use the Ayurveda Panchakarma treatments (five main cleaning treatments) to stop diseases from occurring &amp; to attain or improve good health. These Panchakarma procedures are used to cure &amp; eliminate the root causes or diseases or ailments for people suffering from various kinds of health issues
