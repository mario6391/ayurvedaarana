                                  For the massages and treatments you will receive a sarong, which will also be washed or exchanged daily. You usually wear this sarong the whole day between treatments. Thereby the oil can have a further effect on your skin and you don't have to worry about your clothes. You will be amazed how beautiful a sarong can be wrapped. 
We recommend that you bring cheap or older underwear with you, which often does not wash out the oil well and you may not be able to wear it anymore. 
For meals, yoga and meditation simple, comfortable and light clothes such as t-shirts/tops and shorts/skirt/dresses are all you need.</p>

                                  Our cook prepares all meals according to the needs of each individual patient and in consultation with our doctor. Ayurvedic food consists of a light, predominantly vegetarian diet. If it is beneficial for the health of our guests, fish is also served. Vegetables are usually cooked and eaten warm. The salad offer is limited, since raw food should only be eaten in small portions during the cure. Your Ayurvedic full board includes three meals a day as well as all Ayurvedic teas and water. Fruit juices are also served according to your constitution, and fresh fruit is included daily in the diet. 
We have fixed meal times, as there should be at least four hours between each meal. Ayurveda does not believe in small meals in between as it disturbs the organism and slows down the digestive process. </p>

This is your time - listen to the sound of the sea, the singing birds and let your soul dangle. </p>

                                  During the Ayurveda treatment you should not expose yourself to physical exercise. Sports such as jogging, fitness, active swimming or hiking are not recommended. The physical elimination process that takes place during the cure needs time and rest. Too active movements would distribute the toxins released by the massages and treatments back into the body. Relaxing walks in the morning and evening are recommended and are particularly beautiful along our beach. </p>

                                   In a classical Ayurveda cure, bathing in the sea is not recommended. Not only is it usually too cool, but the pores of the skin are also wide open during the preparation and cleansing phases so that toxins can escape from the body. Conversely, sea pollution can also penetrate our bodies very quickly. 

You can, however, use our swimming pool during the cure to refresh yourself. The water is a bit warmer and clean. Please discuss with the doctor on which days you can use the pool, as there are treatments after which you should not swim. These include forehead forcing and head rinsing. The oil is beneficial for the scalp and should remain in the hair or scalp for at least one hour. Swimming after these treatments can also lead to headaches. Since a doctor is always on site, just ask</p>

                                In the first few days you will probably be relatively tired. This is due to the effects of Ayurveda treatment. Ayurvedic oils have a strong draining and detoxifying function. Tiredness is therefore a normal side effect of the cure. Treat yourself to enough rest, knowing that this will positively support your course of the cure. Because an authentic Ayurveda cure brings with it not only comforting relaxation but also fatigue.</p>

                                 The Ayurveda cure is an intensive cleansing cure that can also weaken and tire the body for some days. Some treatments can temporarily intensify old ailments, such as headaches, nausea, skin rashes or pain. This is normal during Ayurveda and part of the intensive detoxification process where alcohol, nicotine, environmental toxins, drug residues, etc. are excreted. If you experience any symptoms, please inform the doctor. That is why he is there and on site at all times. 

For women it is recommended to start the treatment immediately after menstruation. During pregnancy and in case of infectious diseases, an Ayurvedic cure is not advised.  </p>

                                Spend a lot of time outside with fresh air. We have many places to sit in our garden under the palm trees, which provide shade. Avoid direct sun, cool wind and draughts after the treatments. There are plenty of windless shade places outdoors where you can relax nicely. 

In each of our rooms there is a fan and air conditioning. In the room itself, according to Ayurveda, a ceiling fan makes more sense than air conditioning for the necessary air circulation. On particularly hot days we recommend that you turn on the air conditioning while you are not in the room and use the fan afterwards.

                              During the cure, spend time on pleasant, relaxing things. For example, read easy-going, cheerful magazines and listen to relaxing music, or simply have a chat with other guests. The most important thing is that you feel at ease and treat yourself to the peace and quiet you need. This is your time, enjoy it.  </p>
