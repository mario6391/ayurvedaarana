                                <strong>Doctor Ravindra, or "Doctor Ravi"</strong> as most people call him, has a long history in Ayurvedic medicine. At a young age he entered the Ayurveda Medical Institute at the University of Kelaniya. This is one of the two Ayurveda universities in Sri Lanka. After five intensive years of study and a one-year practical training in a State Ayurvedic Hospital, he successfully completed his studies and received his accreditation from the Government Ayurveda Medical Council. Since then he has worked in several Ayurvedic clinics and resorts in Sri Lanka. For the past 18 years, he's treated and cured mostly western patients and clients.<br><br>With his dedication and knowledge, he has helped many patients to feel better and stronger than ever. When modern school medicine reaches its limits, Dr. Ravi is the right person to find the root cause of any acute or chronic health problem, and treat it accordingly.&nbsp;
